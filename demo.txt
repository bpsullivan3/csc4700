What is your favorite movie?
Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Koln, Germany (aka Cologne but I like the native German name better)

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Perfect photographic memory. It would help me to learn more just by looking at things, and I would never forget a face. I do not want to be a 'hero' and save the world, so perfect memory is the practical for me.
